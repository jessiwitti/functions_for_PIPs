# functions_for_PIPs
Here are three functions we had to program for our course Programming in Psychology 

# Usage 

<b>remind_me()</b>

You can use the remind_me function without any commands

<b>cheat()</b>

You can use the cheat function with one command, which indicates on which question from Assignment 3.1 you want to cheat

exercise = "Q3.1.x"

<b>make_art()</b>

You can use this make_art function to create random art. You can indicate a random number and and a title

number = NULL
title = "Title"

# Examples
<i>#Run this line:</i>

remind_me()

<i>#Run this line:</i>

cheat("Q.3.1.1")


<i>#Run this line:</i>

make_art(2023, "Random Art")
